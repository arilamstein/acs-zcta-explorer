This interactive application allows you to explore the demographics of US Zip Codes. Technically what is being rendered are [ZIP Code Tabulated Areas (ZCTAs)](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html). The data comes from the 2013 [American Community Survey (ACS)](http://www.census.gov/acs/www/).

The source code for this application is available [here](https://github.com/arilamstein/acs-zcta-explorer).

This application is described in more detail in the blog post [Exploring San Francisco with choroplethrZip](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/04/exploring-san-francisco-with-choropleth.html), which was posted on the Revolution Analytics blog on April 17, 2015.
